# [Trail Valle de SamuÃ±o](www.trailvallesamu%C3%B1o.es)
Second iteration of a static website for the Trail Valle de SamuÃ±o, arguably the best trail running race in Asturias (northern Spain). First version was created using Ruby's Middleman static site generator ([original repo](https://github.com/guitarranalon/trailvallesamuno)) now giving a try to Javascript's Astro.
  
 ## Environment
 **node:** v22.4.1  
## ðŸš€ Project Structure

  

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

  

```text

/

â”œâ”€â”€ public/

â”œâ”€â”€ src/

â”‚ â””â”€â”€ pages/

â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.astro

â””â”€â”€ package.json

```

  

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

  

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

  

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

  

## ðŸ§ž Commands

  

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
